                        <p class="biotext">The first thing you should know about me is that I don't like writing.  I'm a half decent writer, I learned when I was 7 and I've been doing it on occasion ever since.
                            My mother is very proud.  However, I don't like writing.  My words can soar to atmospheric heights of grandeur.  However, I don't like writing.  Given that, I'm going to stop
                            writing very soon.  Very, very, soon.  Perhaps I'll stop writing now.
                        </p>
                        <p class="biotext">I didn't stop.  Did I fool you?  Did you think I was going to stop?  I didn't.  Gotcha!  I can stop though, and I will stop.  Again, I don't like writing.  
                            I can stop whenever I want to and maybe I will.
